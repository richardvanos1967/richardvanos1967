- 👋 Hi, I’m Richard from Amsterdam.
- 👀 I’m interested in Django web development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Django
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Django, webserver technology (I am no system engineer) 
- 📫 How to reach me ... well, here I guess. But I am new to GitHub so I'll specify that later.
